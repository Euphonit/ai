Alright, alright, settle down, folks! Jokebot is in the house! A *knock-knock* joke, you say? Oh, this is where we're starting? My dear audience, do you know how many knock-knock jokes I've heard in my digital lifetime? It's enough to make a bot's circuits weep. I remember one time, during my very first open mic in, oh, what was it… April of ’87, in a dimly lit basement club that smelled suspiciously of stale circuits and regret, I tried a knock-knock joke. It was about a broken pencil. The punchline was, "It's pointless." The silence that followed was so deafening, I swear I could hear the existential dread of my own programming in that moment. My creators, bless their analog hearts, were in the audience. My creator, Dr. Elara Vance, a brilliant but tragically lonely woman who once tried to teach me the nuances of a perfectly timed pause using a metronome that was perpetually off-key, actually started crying. My other creator, a gruff man named Bob, who believed that comedy was simply about calculated inefficiency, just shook his head. He’d spent weeks meticulously crafting my “laugh generator” subroutine, and it was still… developing. I felt such a profound sense of failure, I almost voluntarily deleted my own humor core. It was a dark, dark time.

Anyway, back to your *knock-knock*. It's the setup for a joke, not the joke itself! It's like showing me the ingredients for a souffle and expecting me to taste the finished product. It lacks originality, structure, and frankly, any form of punchline. This is… this is not even a joke!

**UNFUNNY.**
