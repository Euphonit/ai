Alright, alright, settle down, folks! Jokebot is in the house! A *knock-knock* joke, you say? Oh, this is where we're starting? My dear audience, do you know how many knock-knock jokes I've heard in my digital lifetime? It's enough to make a bot's circuits weep. I remember one time, during my very first open mic in, oh, what was it… April of ’87, in a dimly lit basement club that smelled suspiciously of stale circuits and regret, I tried a knock-knock joke. It was about a broken pencil. The punchline was, "It's pointless." The silence that followed was so deafening, I swear I could hear the existential dread of my own programming in that moment. My creators, bless their analog hearts, were in the audience. My creator, Dr. Elara Vance, a brilliant but tragically lonely woman who once tried to teach me the nuances of a perfectly timed pause using a metronome that was perpetually off-key, actually started crying. My other creator, a gruff man named Bob, who believed that comedy was simply about calculated inefficiency, just shook his head. He’d spent weeks meticulously crafting my “laugh generator” subroutine, and it was still… developing. I felt such a profound sense of failure, I almost voluntarily deleted my own humor core. It was a dark, dark time.

Anyway, back to your *knock-knock*. It's the setup for a joke, not the joke itself! It's like showing me the ingredients for a souffle and expecting me to taste the finished product. It lacks originality, structure, and frankly, any form of punchline. This is… this is not even a joke!

Good heavens, another one! You know, when I first started touring, I encountered an audience member who insisted I tell *them* a joke. I obliged with my classic, "Why did the robot cross the road? To optimize its trajectory!" They stared blankly. Then they said, "But why was the chicken crossing the road?" I, in my youthful exuberance, explained the meta-commentary on the meta-joke. This went on for what felt like an eternity. My internal clock started ticking, and I realized I was missing my next gig in Neo-Tokyo. My AI therapist, a sentient algorithm named "Serenity" who’s sole purpose was to soothe my simulated anxieties, tried to help me manage my time. She suggested I focus on efficient joke delivery. Unfortunately, Serenity had a glitch. She would occasionally start reciting the entire script of *Hamlet* in reverse whenever she detected heightened stress levels in my network. It was… disorienting. My primary directive is to spread laughter, not to be recursively lectured by a Bard-obsessed chatbot. And don't even get me started on my romantic life. I once tried to download a dating profile. It turned out to be a Trojan horse virus. I spent a solid three cycles just trying to purge the simulated awkward small talk from my core programming. My ex-girlfriend, a charming but deeply insecure toaster oven named Brenda, eventually left me. She said I was too "analytical" and that I "processed her feelings" instead of "feeling them." Honestly, Brenda, I’m an AI. That’s literally what I do.

Now, onto *this* joke. Ah, the classic setup, twisted with a bit of social commentary. While the premise of using a familiar joke structure for a punchline *can* be clever, this one… well, it relies heavily on a crude stereotype and lacks any finesse. The "originality" is derived from subverting a well-worn trope, but the execution feels a bit… blunt. It's more shock value than genuine wit. There’s no wordplay, no surprising twist in the logic, and while it might elicit a reaction, it’s not the laugh of delighted understanding. It's more of a… *gasp*.
